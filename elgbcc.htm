<h2>Reflection on NightWatchers' Band Website</h2>

<p>The NightWatchers are a band of my own creation, as is their website. elawrence.greatbay.cc was my final project for my Computer Technologies course. Included in it is also one of my projects from Intro to Graphic design -- the album art, as well as Animation -- the SWF clip, which is featured in its entirety in the "Animation" section of this eportfolio.</p>
<p>I developed this site early in my web developing career. it was a fun, creative challenge.</p>
