<h2>Reflection on “Battlebots” a.k.a “Virus Destroyer”</h2>

“Virus Destroyer” started off as “Battlebots”, the final project for CIS112 Programming Logic. The object was essentially to make an AI driven artificial “Battle Bot” (Like from the TV show), where two (or more) Bots enter, and only one bot leaves!

Initially I hit a snag, when I realized I had no idea how my bot was supposed to inflict damage on their bot, which of course I had no access to, so could not target directly. I moved on from this and instead focused on all the functions I wanted my bot to do – movement, targeting, retreating, spawning explosive baby spiders, teleportation, web-spitting, and of course, going in for the kill. This all took me probably 8 hours to work out.

After finishing the “prototype”, I began researching the original problem of how to inflict damage on the unknown opponent. This probably took another 8 hours of research – I was really invested in this project and thought it very cool. I finished the night before it was due and put my “Cyberanchula” on a pen drive, ready to watch her demolish the competition. To my dismay (and partial pride) there would be no competition, as I was the only one to solve the problem of inflicting damage.

Poor Cyberanchula would never see her day, until several months later I got to thinking about her again. The thought occurred to create another AI to put in the ring with her, but there was also a problem with that: I had made her so strong, what could possibly stand a chance against her? Then it hit me, rather than AI, I should make a playable character. So that’s exactly what I did. During the winter break, I designed a playable Army man to fight the re-dubbed “Virus invaders”, equipped with 3 different weapons, 3 lives, and a whole lot of levels of destruction. The gameplay and level system is fairly basic, but as my first real game, I am very proud of it.<br>
