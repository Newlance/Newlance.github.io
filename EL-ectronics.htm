<h2>Reflection on <a href="http://EL-ectronics.com/">EL-ectronics.com</a> website</h2>

“EL-ectronics” is a do-all electronics business I started in 2014, which is the reimagining of a small craigslist-based business I started back in 2005 crudely dubbed "EWXL Et Al". Along with a new site and new ideals, EL-ectronics aims to greatly broaden our scope by offering essentially every electronics related service. At our most basic summation, we are a computer repair company; however we do so much more than that. We fix desktops, laptops, tablets, phones, and even televisions. We install and configure software for personal and professional use both at our location and the customer’s. We offer data backup and recovery. We also install home equipment, such as home theater systems, wireless networks, home security, and more. We also offer economy-grade web development for small businesses and personal use. These are only the most common services we offer, but if the customer has a project that is not listed, we will research the topic and provide you with a solution that works for the customer.

This is our view from the outside. From a more personal perspective, EL-ectronics is my baby. I’ve done everything to build this company from the ground up. I manage the finances, thanks to the accounting classes I’ve taken. I manage the database, thanks to the database classes I’ve taken. I manage the hiring and firing and general managerial duties, thanks to the business management classes I’ve taken. I developed and host the business website, thanks to a variety of other classes I’ve taken. My goal was to do this on my own, to see how much I have learned, and apply that knowledge, and I have to admit, I am not unimpressed with my growth as a computer technician, as a businessman, and as a human being in general.
