                    <p>Welcome to the Programming section of my ePortfolio. This section is dedicated to my favorite pasttime: Programming! Nothing puts a smile on my face like a good puzzle, and there is no puzzle better than making something work through the use of code! While the majority of my work would be difficult to display in a graphical sense, as it goes on behind the scenes, I hope you will still enjoy what I have here to share. From video games to tools and gagets. 'Tis a Programmer's Life for Me!</p>

            <h1>Website Design and Development</h1>
            <p>Website development is an interesting middle ground for anyone with a programming mindset. Web design requires more than just understanding of programming languages, it also requires a knack for visual design and color. Some would argue these skills are becoming more important than language, as web development grows closer to being an automated process. While this may be true, there is still plenty of room for Web Programmers. The fact is, someone must be developing these "easy-to-use web design tools" that you see, such as WordPress. This is certainly where I would feel most comfortable; however, comfort is a leisure the programmer can seldom afford. The programmer must adapt to overcome new arising obstacles. </p>

            	<h1>Essays, Presentations, and other Research Assignments</h1>
                <p>Long hours, hard work, structured and well thoughtout results. These assignments, whether they be group or independant, all offered me the opportunit to explore both my own interests as well as subjects I may not have educated myself on otherwise. Research assignments are, in my oppinion, the most thourough way to educate yourself on a given topic, even if a bit dry at times. Well, I hope you won't find this reading dry! This is my research assignment section, where you will see various assignments I have completed at Great Bay Community College.</p>

                <h1>Creativity in Motion</h1>
                <p>Animation can be tedius, espcially for a beginner, but the rewards are incredible. If you have the patience to move an entire scene, a frame at a time, you can truely create "movie magic". As a comedy fan myself, I enjoyed creating some goofy random videos in hopes to cause a couple laughs. I may never be youtube famous, but I enjoyed making these, and I hope you enjoy watching them!</p>
