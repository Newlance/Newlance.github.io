<h2>The Forgotten Backpack</h2>

“The Forgotten Backpack” is a stop animation project I did with a classmate, Chris, for our Introduction to Animation mid-term. This project involved a lot of collaboration and brainstorming, as the project criteria were fairly loose. We were not limited in duration, topic, or medium, as long as the end result was a moving picture that told some sort of story. From the get-go we realized we were both comedians, and therefor had to do something funny.

We started with some Legos but realized that so much of our time would be spent on carefully repositioning the toys that we would not have time for much else and therefore speculated that it would be unlikely that we would reach our goals. We scrapped that idea and picked up a camera and a tripod and started shooting.

At first the whole idea was just funny ways to get from the bottom floor to the top, Chris came up with the idea of a “goal” or in this case, the “forgotten backpack”. We had a lot of fun coming up with different animations, such as when Chris “slid” up the stairs backwards – Chris’s idea, which he later confessed only came to mind because he was really exhausted from jumping up the first two flights. Sometimes brilliance is on accident. Another accidental bit of brilliance is when Chris was a “helicopter”, during his spin, he accidentally hit one of the trash cans. We were going to retake that, but decided to make a gag out of it.

After we had finished taking all the photos we needed, we took turns recording various sounds, and then I went to work putting it all together that night. I also decided to add in a little cartoon animation by adding some framework (intro and credits) which I felt brought a little more life and comedy to the story.
