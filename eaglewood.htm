<h2>Reflection on EagleWoodFloors.com Website</h2>

<p>This was a very interesting project as it was the first website I had ever been hired to reverse engineer. The owner had hired a web designer to build a website for his business. The end result was quite beautiful. Unfortunately the website was hosted under the owner’s father-in-law’s hosting profile, who absentmindedly deleted his account, not realizing the website would be lost in the process. Even worse, the original designer did not keep a backup of his work. Great effort was put forth by myself, the owner, and the designer to somehow restore the original, but due to the fact the designer used WordPress, recovery was impossible. A splash page was all that could be restored, and the original designer was at a loss.</p>

<p>It wasn’t until several months later I decided to give it one more go and possibly rebuilding it from scratch. When consulting with the original designer, he mentioned getting an idea of what the original page looked like by using the way back machine. This was a better idea than the designer had realized, as not only did this give me an idea of the original page, but I was able to take all the HTML, scripts, and stylesheets from it as well. Of course this required quite a bit of reworking as the "snapshot" was not in a perfect state, I had to remove a lot of the generated code, rework the scripts and styles, and there were some aspects of the splash page I incorporated into the final product. The greatest amount of work went into making sure the styles were perfect, functional, and responsive. This took close to 30 hours over the course of 3 or 4 days. Once the front page was finished, it was only a matter of another 10 hours over the next couple days for me to put up the remaining six pages.</p>

<p>The owner was very satisfied with the end result, and relieved that his business's page was functional again, so much so that he gave me his blessing to marry his daughter! In my opinion, a much better deal than the other designer got!</p>
