<p>Hello and Welcome. My name is Evan Lawrence, owner and primary technology specialist at <a href="http://EL-ectronics.com">EL-ectronics.com</a>. EL-ectronics is a do-all electronics business I started in 2014, which is the reimagining of a small craigslist-based business I started back in 2005 crudely dubbed "EWXL Et Al". Along with a new site and new ideals, EL-ectronics aims to greatly broaden our scope by offering essentially every electronics related service. At our most basic summation, we are a computer repair company; however we do so much more than that. We fix desktops, laptops, tablets, phones, and even televisions. We install and configure software for personal and professional use both at our location and yours. We offer data backup and recovery. We also install home equipment, such as home theater systems, wireless networks, home security, and more. We also offer economy-grade web development for small businesses and personal use. These are only the most common services we offer, but if you have a project that is not listed, we will research the topic and provide you with a solution that works for you.  Of course all this information is available on our website, so let me branch away from business and tell you a little more about me.</p>
    
  <p>I grew up in New Hampshire, developing a passion for technology at an early age. By 10 I had already broken, torn apart, and rebuilt and fixed more computers that most kids my age had ever used. I was fascinated with all the working components, and how the software utilized these components to create a user interface. By 15 I had already developed a half dozen or more webpages using HTML and JavaScript on free hosting sites such as geocities and angelfire. HTML was fairly quick and easy for my purposes. I had no use for CSS at the time. I found JavaScript to be very interesting and spent a good deal of my time developing unique scripts, such as a script that blocked the popup ads found on these free hosting sites, a script that would send me information of my visitors (basically an early google analytics), as well as a method of integrating the ROT13 encryption into my code to prevent the user from viewing my source code. Solving puzzles like these has always been my true definition of fun!</p>

<p>If I wasn't building I was breaking. I spent hours opening various files ( .exe's, .dll's, etc.) in notepad and scrolling through all the gibberish to try to get an idea of what was really going on. By 17 I had obtained a copy of Visual Studio 6.0 and began teaching myself VB, making simple applications along the way. While my friends had their Sudoku, I had my programming!</p>

<p>Flash forward to January 30th, 2015. Today I am 26 and more interested than ever. I am student at Great Bay Community college. I will obtain my Associates Degree in Computer Technology at the end of this semester. From there I plan to transfer to Southern New Hampshire University where I will obtain my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Programming with a focus on video game design. I am self-employed and fully motivated. "2013 was practice, 2014 was the warm up, 2015 is game time!"</p>
