<h2>Page the Doctor</h2>

“Page the Doctor” was an attempt at a humorous animated music video I made for Intro to Animation. I had started with a song I wrote about a hospital patient whose condition had worsened after being fed the hospital’s food.  A good portion of the time spent on this project was in the concept art stages, where I hand drew a series of comic book style art which I then used to begin producing the final product. From there I began rendering my character creations as digital artwork; a task more difficult than I had originally anticipated. Additionally I found that while the song had a very quick tempo, trying to convert this into an animation using completely different voices and also without making it seem rushed or unnatural became another big challenge. Despite pulling an all-nighter, I reluctantly admitted it would not be possible to incorporate all my ideas into the video within the time constrictions and therefore opted to provide a humorous, albeit abrupt, ending to the skit.
<br>
If I could do it over, I would allot more time to the actual animation process and less on brainstorming, and perhaps picked a more suitable song/tempo for the animation genre. Nonetheless, it was a very interesting project, and I feel I gained quite a bit of insight on what goes into making animated videos, as well as demonstrated and improved upon my problem solving abilities.
